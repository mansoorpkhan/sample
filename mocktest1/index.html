    <!--OL: it stands for ordered list, which gives lists as numerical, upper case alphabets, Lower case alphabets, Captical romans, Small romans -->
    <!--UL: it stands for unordered list, which gives lists as Disc, Circle, Square -->
    <!--DL: it stands for definition list, which gives description in the list -->


    <p>In the first question, we used DOCTYPE html, html, head and body tags to provide the title to the web page. In the second question, we given heading using h1 tag in the html. In the third question, we created an ordered list using "ol" tag giving "steps to create a web page" as a list with 4 to 5 steps. later i used  nested unordered list to list sub steps for an ordered list. Later i created an unordered list using UL tag to give my five favorite programming languages. after creating a discription list to describe HTML, CSS, JavaScript. i we used one type attribute in ordered list using type="A". we added comments in the code to differentiate between OL,UL & DL. and we used proper indentiton and clean formatting to maintain the HTML structure. </p>
